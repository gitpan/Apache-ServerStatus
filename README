    reference with the counted status. There are diffenrent keys that
    contains the following counts:

       r    Requests currenty being processed
       i    Idle workers
       p    Parents

       I    Idle cleanup of worker
       .    Open slot with no current process

  errstr()
    "errstr()" contains the error string if the requests fails.

OPTIONS
    You have to set all options by the call of "get()".

    There are only two options: "request" and "timeout".

    Set "request" with the complete uri like
    "http://localhost/server-status". There is only http supported, not
    https or other protocols.

    Set "timeout" to define the time in seconds to abort the request if
    there is no response. The default is set to 180 secondes if the options
    isn't set.
